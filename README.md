This repository contains a comprehensive data science project that follows the full data science lifecycle â€” from data collection and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization. The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights and build predictive models using real-world data.

The project utilizes tools and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks, and showcases practical applications of machine learning techniques including regression, classification, and clustering (as applicable).

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn, or an experienced data scientist reviewing different approaches, this project is designed to be clear, modular, and easy to follow.
